Idea: grabbing older snapshots of IANA root db from archive.org! Maybe every
six months - say, end of June and end of December - starting in 2012 when the

A quick check shows that the HTML table format is different and my existing
Lua patterns don't match, so work is required there. Let's get a list of
candidate URLs that we can curl:
