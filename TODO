Change matching and printing to be more generic.

- Have a set of output types: sheet, table, text, wiki, html...

- Have an optional "match <pat>" or "-match <pat>" at the end.

- Always generate an annotated list, with "donuts", "amazon", "google", etc in
  the annotation field.

So I need a way to translate nicknames ("google") to matches ("Charleston Road
Registry") - for the match phrase - and the other way - the annotation field.
